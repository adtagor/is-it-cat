Is It Cat?
=========================

This is the source code for the bot, who runs on AWS servers.

Setup: Keras on Tensorflow, python3 and nodejs.

To run, after everything else is set up,

    npm install
    npm run start
    
This implies you have installed all the needed python libraries.

Everytime picture is sent to the bot, he saves them into `public/photos` directory.
